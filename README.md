# Achiievo 

## Overview

Achiievo is a dynamic leaderboard platform designed to track task completion and reward users based on their achievements. With its gamified approach, Achiievo fosters healthy competition and motivation by allowing participants to accumulate points, awarded by an admin, to climb the leaderboard. This platform is ideal for use in teams, classrooms, or any challenge-based environment where engagement and performance are critical.

Participants can view their ranks, and admins have control over assigning tasks and points, thus maintaining the leaderboardâ€™s integrity and fairness.
